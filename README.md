# Car Black Box Project using PIC18F4580
 The Car Black Box is an embedded system designed to monitor and record critical data related to a vehicle's operation, similar to an aircraft's black box. This project leverages the PIC18F4580 microcontroller, known for its advanced automotive features and CAN (Controller Area Network) support, making it ideal for vehicular applications.

 Key Features:
* Real-Time Data Recording: Captures and stores essential parameters such as speed, temperature, engine status, and GPS location.
* Accident Detection: Utilizes sensors (e.g., accelerometer) to detect sudden impacts or accidents.
* CAN Communication: The PIC18F4580â€™s built-in CAN module enables integration with the vehicle's CAN bus for seamless data collection from onboard systems.
* Data Logging: Uses external memory (EEPROM or SD card) to store recorded data for post-event analysis.
* User Interface: Incorporates an LCD display for real-time data viewing and debugging.

Advantages:
* Helps investigate accidents by providing detailed records of vehicle operation.
* Assists in identifying faults or malfunctions in the vehicle systems.
* Improves driver safety by monitoring critical parameters in real-time.

Applications:
* Automotive safety and accident analysis.
* Fleet management systems.
* Driver behavior monitoring.
